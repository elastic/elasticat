## What's New

- AI Chat is now accessible only via dedicated hotkeys (`c` to open, `C` to send selected item)
  - Removed from signal cycle (`m` key) which now cycles: logs → traces → metrics
  - Chat remains fully functional, just no longer part of the main signal rotation

- New `elasticat mcp` command generates MCP server configuration for the current profile
  - Outputs JSON config for connecting Elastic Agent Builder to MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
  - Respects `--profile` flag to generate config for different environments
  - Example: `elasticat mcp | pbcopy` to copy config to clipboard
